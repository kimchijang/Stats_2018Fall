## Download
You can download the class materials using the following command line.

	$ git clone https://github.com/wanirepo/Stats_2018Fall.git

Once you clone the github repository, you can just type the following command to get the updated github repository. 

	$ git pull
	
Or you can download the repository as a zip file or you can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). The class materials will be uploaded (e.g., lecture slides, assignments) before each class. 

There is a good github tutorial: [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html)

## What are the aims of this course?

Data are everywhere. Data science already became a key element in many research and industrial areas. The primary aim of this course is to learn basic concepts and skills for data analysis, including concepts of random variables, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, linear modeling, data visualization, etc., preparing you for your life after the graduation in this data-are-everywhere age. However, this is not the only aim of this class. Statistics goes beyond just data analysis, I believe. Statistics is a way of thinking and reasoning. It helps with scientific reasoning and critical thinking. Thus, I hope this class could provide you with some useful tips for scientific thinking and reasoning. Finally, I'd like to give you some hands-on experience of data analysis. We will mainly use JASP (https://jasp-stats.org) and MATLAB in class.

## Textbooks

Main textbook: <br>
>"Stats: Data and Models" by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock

## Course format and expectations

This course will combine lectures with some practical hands-on experience of statistical data analysis. We will use English as the main language, but you can use Korean to ask questions and discuss. 


## Evaluation

1. Attendance (25%)
2. Assignments (two times) (10%)
3. Quizes (twice) (10%)
4. Project (10%)
5. Midterm exam (20%)
6. Final exam (25%)

## Project

The class project will be a literature review or tutorial on a topic that is related to data analysis and statistics. For example, you can study and introduce data analysis methods that are commonly used in your research area, but are not covered in the class. E.g., bayesian modeling, machine learning, network science, clustering, mediation analysis, structural equation modeling, etc. Or you can do a literature review on recent debates and issues in statistics and data analysis. E.g., reproducibility crisis, p-hacking, statistical power, etc. I will show you some examples in the class.
