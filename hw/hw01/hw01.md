## Homework assignment 1

### Topic: Regression and residual plots


- Tasks: complete the function, `run_regression_all.m` and get three passes in `unit_test.m` (these functions are located in /hw/hw01 of the current repository)
- Deadline: 9/29 (Fri) 12:00AM (midnight)
- Submit: Email your `run_regression_all.m` to me via email (choongwan.woo@gmail.com).

Note: when you complete the function, `run_regression_all.m`, please do not use pinv(x)\*y or x\y to calculate the coefficient. Our slides on regression should have the answer. :)

### 1) complete run\_regression\_all.m

Let's see the help of the function first. 

```
>> help run_regression_all.m

a function to run regression analysis for two variables and draw scatter
and residual plots
  
  :Usage:
  ::
  
      stats = run_regression_all(x, y)
 
  :Inputs:
 
    **x:**
         a vector, independent variable
 
    **y:**
         a vector, dependent variable
 
  :Outputs:
 
    **stats:**
         stats.x          x values
         stats.y          y values
         stats.b1         regression coefficient
         stats.b0         intercept
         stats.R2         R-squared of the model
         stats.yhat       predicted y based on the model and x
         stats.residuals  residuals (a vector)
 
  :Examples:
   x = rand(100,1);
   y = x*1.3 + rand(100,1);
   stats = run_regression_all(x, y);
```

There are multiple places that contain incomplete code lines, where you will see the following flags:

```
% ------------------- complete this part ---------------------

% ------------------------------------------------------------
```

### 2) get three passes in unit\_test.m

Let's see the help of the function first. 

```
>>> help unit_test

Instruction: Please go to the directory where your code is, and type the 
following line.
 
unit_test(pwd)
```

If you run this code `unit_test(pwd)` in the directory where your `run_regression_all.m` is, you will see three passes or some fails. 

If you run it without completing `run_regression_all.m`, it will produce the following error. 

```
>> unit_test(pwd)
오류: 파일: run_regression_all.m 라인: 53 열: 12
표현식 또는 명령문이 불완전하거나 잘못되었습니다.

오류 발생: unit_test (line 15)
stats = run_regression_all(x,y);
```

If you run it after completing `run_regression_all.m`, it will show the following messages, and will open three figure windows. 

```
>> unit_test(pwd)

Test 1: Pass
Test 2: Pass
Test 3: Pass
```

Then, you're done!
